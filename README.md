# DESIGN THINKING PROJECT

💡 Design Thinking Project — Future Digital Campus

For our design thinking project, my team and I worked on a system prototype under the theme Future Digital Campus, focusing on how digital technology can improve efficiency, security, and the overall student experience.

🚀 Project overview:

-Designed a Student Face Scan System for attendance purposes

-Aims to reduce time spent on attendance during lectures

-Uses facial recognition instead of matric cards or manual methods

🎯 Problem we identified:

-Students often forget or lose their matric cards

-Attendance cheating can easily happen in large classes

-Traditional attendance methods are time-consuming and inefficient

🛠️ How our system helps:

-Verifies student identity using face scanning technology

-Allows attendance to be recorded quickly and accurately

-Reduces dependency on physical cards

-Minimises attendance fraud during lectures

🔐 Additional benefits:

-Improves campus safety by ensuring only registered students are verified

-Increases reliability and accuracy through biometric verification

-Supports smarter campus management using digital solutions

✨ Key takeaway:

 This project helped me understand how user-centred design and digital technology can be combined to solve real campus problems. The Student Face Scan System reflects how future-ready digital solutions can support efficiency, security, and digital transformation in a university environment.
